# CV_project
## Introduction
In this project we implement the main algorithm for plate detection which is formed by YOLOv5 and PDLPR and then we compare it to a baseline method composed by traditional technique for plate area detection and CNN + CTC for plate character recognition.

We used both visual studio as a repository and a python notebook that can work with GPU, so we put both

## Folder structure
- /dataset: here there are the images and the labels that are used for the training testing and validation, /cropped_images and /labels_pdlpr are used for the second part of character recognition in PDLPR and in the CNN + CTC method.
- /metrics_images: here there are the images generated during training by the models, they include the images for training and validation over epoch for character accuracy and full plate sequence accuracy
- /models: the saved models for CNNCTC that are then loaded for the testing phase
- /results: here there are txt files which contains the result metrics for the training and testing phase for each model
- /runs: results of the yolo models
    - TRAIN: contains a folder for each execution of model.train() with different hyperparameters
    each folder contains:
        - a folder with the weights of the best and the last model
        - the plots (automatically generated by YOLO) for F1 curve, precision, recall, and the general results (both in png and csv format) containing also the loss and the mean Average Precision values
    - DETECT: contains a folder for each execution of best_model.val([...], split=”val”, [...]) with different hyperparameters
    each folder contains:
        - the plots (automatically generated by YOLO) for F1 curve, precision, and recall
        - a mean_iou.txt file containing the mean IoU value over the validation set
    - TEST: contains a folder for each execution of model.val([...], split=”test”, [...]) with different hyperparameters
    each folder contains:
        - the plots (automatically generated by YOLO) for F1 curve, precision, and recall
        - a test_metrics.txt file containing the value for mean Average Precision, precision, recall, and mean IoU over the test set


## File structure
Since we implemented two different methods each one of them divided into two parts we decided to have separate files for training and evaluation (testing) for each method.

- globals.py: contains the constants used in this repository
- utils.py: useful functions and also the definition of the evaluator class  and the function that does plate detection using traditional techniques.
- network.py: definition of the NN for the PDLPR and the CNN CTC.
- data.py: the dataset class for CCPD is defined here

### Training
- train_baseline_cnnctc.py: The training code for the character recognition of the CNNCTC part for the baseline method, here we try different hyperparameters combination.
- train_pdlpr.py: The training code for the pdlpr character recognition part.
- train_yolo.py: The training code for YOLOv5 license plate detection.

### Evaluation
These file are the testing for the single individual part
- test_baseline_cnnctc.py: testing for baseline CNNCTC method.
- test_pdlpr.py: testing for PDLPR
- test_baseline_traditional.py: testing for the plate detection using traditional techniques, this doesn't require training so it does not have the train file counterpart.
- test_yolo.py: testing for YOLO
#### Other evaluation files
- baseline_detection.py: here we use traitional techniques like Canny edge detector to do plate detection. This does not require any training. We compute the average intersection over union over all the predictions. 
Then there are two files that implements two pipelines, that test the two methods (YOLOv5 + PDLPR) and (traditional + CNNCTC) by considering one image at a time, segmenting it and then inputting it directly to the character detection to make the final prediction.

- pipeline_testing.py: the pipeline of the method in the paper that loads our trained models and compute the accuracy
- pipeline_baseline_testing.py: the pipeline of the baseline method

### Notebook
In the notebook CV_project.ipynb we have the exact same code in the files above but structured in the notebook format

### Other files
- ccpd.yaml is the file that YOLO uses for loading the database so without using our custom class
- vocab.json contains the vocabulary dictionary that is used by PDLPR and it is generated during training
